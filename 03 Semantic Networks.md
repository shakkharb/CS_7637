# 03 Semantic Networks

## Knowledge Representations
A very simple knowledge representation, in which there are two things.

There is a language of algebraic equations, y s equal to b x, for example. And then there is the content of our knowledge of

Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration.

## Problem-solving with Semantic Networks
Characteristics of good representations:
* Make relationships explicit
* Expose natural constraints
* Bring objects and relations together
* Exclude extraneous details
* Transparent, concise, complete, fast, computable
## Represent & Reason
Choosing Matches by weights

How is semantic networks connected with human cognition?

Well we can make at least two connections immediately. First, semantic networks are kind of knowledge representation. We saw hive knowledge is presented as a semantic network. If the results of [UNKNOWN] representation, then you can use the knowledge presentation to address the problem.

We can now say similarly for human mind that human mind represents problems.

It represents knowledge. Then it uses that knowledge to address the problem.

So, representation then becomes the key. Second, and most specifically, semantic networks are related to spreading activation networks, which is a very popular theory of human memory.
