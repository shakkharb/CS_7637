# 01 Intro to Knowledge Based AI

## Conundrums and Characteristics
Conundrums:
* Intelligent agents have limited resources
*  Computation is local, but problems have global constraints
*  Logic is deductive, but many problems are not
*  The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited
*  Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex, but explanation and justification are even more complex

Characteristics of AI Problems:
* Knowledge often arrives incrementally
* Problems exhibit recurring patterns
* Problems have multiple levels of granularity
* Many problems are computationally intractable
* The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static
* The world is open-ended, but knowledge is limited

Characteristics of AI Agents:
* Agents have limited computing power
* Agents have limited sensors
* Agents have limited attention
* Computational Logic is fundamentally deductive
* AI agents' knowledge is incomplete relative to the world
## Four Schools of AI

**Reasoning** 
**Learning** 
**Memory** 
The three processes put together is referred to as *deliberation*

## What is KBAI?
The twin goals of knowledge-based artificial intelligence (AI) are to build AI agents capable of human-level intelligence and gain insights into human cognition.

## Cognitive Systems

Cognitive, in this context, means dealing with human- like intelligence. The ultimate goal is to dwell up human level, human-like intelligence. Systems, in this context, means having multiple interacting components, such as learning, reasoning and memory. Cognitive systems, they are systems that exhibit human level, human-like intelligence through interaction among components like learning, reasoning and memory.
